 *
 * @brief The Elementary photo widget is intended for displaying a photo,
 *        for eg., a person's image (contact).
 *
 * Simple, yet with a very specific purpose. It has a decorative frame around
 * the inner image itself, on the default theme. If and while no photo is set
 * on it, it displays a person icon, indicating it's a photo placeholder.
 *
 * This widget relies on an internal @ref Icon, so that the APIs of
 * these two widgets are similar (drag and drop is also possible here,
 * for example).
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 * - @c "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the photo.
 * - @c "drag,start" - One has started dragging the inner image out of the
 *                     photo's frame.
 * - @c "drag,end" - One has dropped the dragged image somewhere.
