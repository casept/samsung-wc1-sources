 *
 * @brief This widget holds @c 2 content objects(Evas_Object): one on the front
 *        and one on the back. It allows you to flip from front to back and 
 *        vice-versa using various animations.
 *
 * If either the front or back contents are not set, the flip treats that
 * as transparent. So if you were to set the front content but not the back,
 * and then call elm_flip_go() you would see whatever is below the flip.
 *
 * For a list of supported animations see elm_flip_go().
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 * "animate,begin" - When a flip animation is started
 * "animate,done" - When a flip animation is finished
 *
 * The default content parts of the flip widget that you can use are:
 * @li "front" - The front content of the flip.
 * @li "back" - The back content of the flip.
 *
 * This widget inherits from @ref elm-container-class, so that the
 * functions meant to act on it works for mapbuf objects:
 *
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_get
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_unset
 *
 * @ref tutorial_flip shows how to use most of the API.
