 * @brief Different widgets can be scaled independently. These functions
 *        allow you to manipulate this scaling on a per-widget basis. The
 *        object and all its children get their scaling factors multiplied
 *        by the scale factor set. This is multiplicative, in that if a
 *        child also has a scale size set, it is in turn multiplied by its
 *        parent's scale size. @c 1.0 means “don't scale”, @c 2.0 is
 *        double size, @c 0.5 is half, etc.
 *
 * @ref general_functions_example_page "This" example contemplates
 * some of these functions.
