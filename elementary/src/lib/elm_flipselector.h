 *
 * A flip selector is a widget to show a set of @b text items, one
 * at a time, with the same sheet switching style as the @ref Clock
 * "clock" widget, when one changes the current displaying sheet
 * (thus, the word "flip" in the name).
 *
 * User clicks to flip sheets which are @b held for some time which
 * make the flip selector to flip continuously and automatically for
 * the user. The interval between flips keep growing with time,
 * so that it helps the user to reach an item which is distant from
 * the current selection.
 *
 * This widget inherits from the @ref Layout one, so that all the
 * functions acting on it also work for flip selector objects.
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref Layout:
 * - @c "selected" - When the widget's selected text item is changed.
 * - @c "overflowed" - When the widget's current selection is changed
 *   from the first item in its list to the last.
 * - @c "underflowed" - When the widget's current selection is changed
 *   from the last item in its list to the first.
 *
 * Available styles for it:
 * - @c "default"
 *
 * The default text parts of the flipselector items that you can use are:
 * @li "default" - Label of the flipselector item.
 *
 * Supported common elm_object APIs.
 * @li @ref elm_object_disabled_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_disabled_get
 *
 * Supported common elm_object_item APIs.
 * @li @ref elm_object_item_text_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_item_part_text_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_item_signal_emit
 *
 * Here is an example of its usage:
