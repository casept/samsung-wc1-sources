 *
 * @brief Photocam is a widget meant specifically for displaying
 *        high-resolution digital camera photos, giving speedy feedback
 *        (fast * load), zooming and panning as well as fitting logic, all with
 *        low memory footprint.
 *
 * It is entirely focused on @b jpeg images, and takes advantage of the
 * properties of the jpeg format (via Evas loader features in the jpeg loader).
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 * @li @c "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the photo
 *        without dragging around.
 * @li @c "press" - This is called when a user has pressed down on the
 *        photo.
 * @li @c "longpressed" - This is called when a user has pressed down
 *        on the photo for a long time without dragging around.
 * @li @c "clicked,double" - This is called when a user has
 *        double-clicked the photo.
 * @li @c "load" - Photo load begins.
 * @li @c "loaded" - This is called when the image file load is
 *        completed for the first view (low resolution blurry version).
 * @li @c "load,detail" - Detailed photo data load begins.
 * @li @c "loaded,detail" - This is called when the image file load is
 *        completed with the detailed image data (full resolution
 *        needed).
 * @li @c "zoom,start" - Zoom animation started.
 * @li @c "zoom,stop" - Zoom animation stopped.
 * @li @c "zoom,change" - Zoom changed when using the auto zoom mode.
 * @li @c "scroll" - The content has been scrolled (moved).
 * @li @c "scroll,anim,start" - Scrolling animation has started.
 * @li @c "scroll,anim,stop" - Scrolling animation has stopped.
 * @li @c "scroll,drag,start" - Dragging the contents around has started.
 * @li @c "scroll,drag,stop" - Dragging the contents around has stopped.
 *
 * This widget implements the @b @ref elm-scrollable-interface
 * interface, so that all (non-deprecated) functions for the base @ref
 * Scroller widget also work for photocam objects.
 *
 * Some calls on the photocam's API are marked as @b deprecated, as
 * they just wrap the scrollable widget's counterpart functions. Use
 * the ones mentioned for each case of deprecation here.
 * Eventually, the deprecated ones are discarded (next
 * major release).
 *
 * @ref tutorial_photocam shows the API in action.
