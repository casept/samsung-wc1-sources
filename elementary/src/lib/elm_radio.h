 *
 * @brief Radio is a widget that allows for @c 1 or more options to be displayed
 * and have the user choose only @c 1 of them.
 *
 * A radio object contains an indicator, an optional Label and an optional
 * icon object. While it's possible to have a group of only one radio, they
 * are normally used in groups of @c 2 or more.
 *
 * elm_radio objects are grouped in a slightly different manner compared to other
 * UI toolkits. There is no separate group name/id to remember or manage.
 * The members represent the group there are in. To make a group,
 * use elm_radio_group_add() and pass an existing radio object and the new radio
 * object.
 *
 * The radio object(s) select one from a set
 * of integer values, so any value they are configuring needs to be mapped to
 * a set of integers. To configure what value that radio object represents,
 * use  elm_radio_state_value_set() to set the integer it represents. To set
 * the value the whole group(which one is currently selected) is to indicate
 * use elm_radio_value_set() on any group member, and to get the groups value
 * use elm_radio_value_get(). For convenience the radio objects are also able
 * to directly set an integer(int) to the value that is selected. To specify
 * the pointer to this integer to modify, use elm_radio_value_pointer_set().
 * The radio objects modify this directly. That implies the pointer must
 * point to a valid memory for as long as the radio objects exist.
 *
 * This widget inherits from the @ref Layout one, so that all the
 * functions acting on it also work for radio objects.
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref Layout:
 * @li changed - This is called whenever the user changes the state of one of
 * the radio objects within the group of radio objects that work together.
 *
 * The default text parts of the radio widget that you can use are:
 * @li "default" - Label of the radio.
 *
 * The default content parts of the radio widget that you can use are:
 * @li "icon" - An icon of the radio.
 *
 * Supported common elm_object APIs.
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_text_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_text_get
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_get
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_unset
 * @li @ref elm_object_disabled_set
 * @li @ref elm_object_disabled_get
 *
 * @ref tutorial_radio shows most of this API in action.
