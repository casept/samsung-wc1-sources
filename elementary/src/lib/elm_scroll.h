/**
 * @defgroup Scrollhints Scrollhints
 * @ingroup elm_infra_group
 * @brief This group provides functions to handle scroll behavior of Elementary
 *        Widgets.
 *
 * Objects when inside a scroller can scroll, but this may not always be
 * desirable in certain situations. This allows an object to hint to itself
 * and its parents to "not scroll" in one of the following 2 ways. If any child object of a
 * scroller has pushed a scroll freeze or hold then it affects all parent
 * scrollers until all children have released them.
 *
 * 1. To hold on scrolling. This means just flicking and dragging may no
 * longer scroll, but pressing/dragging near the edge of the scroller
 * still scrolls. This is automatically used by the entry object when
 * selecting text.
 *
 * 2. To totally freeze scrolling. This means it stops until
 * popped/released.
