 * @brief <b>Dayselector widget:</b>
 *
 *"elm_dayselector" is a day selection widget. It displays all seven days of
 * the week and allows the user to select multiple days.
 *
 * The selection can be toggled by just clicking on the day.
 *
 * Dayselector also provides the functionality to check whether a day is
 * selected or not.
 *
 * First day of the week is taken from the config settings by default. It can be
 * altered by using the elm_dayselector_week_start_set() API.
 *
 * APIs are provided for setting the duration of weekend
 * elm_dayselector_weekend_start_set() and elm_dayselector_weekend_length_set()
 * does this job.
 *
 * Two styles of weekdays and weekends are supported in Dayselector.
 * Applications can emit signals on individual check objects for setting the
 * weekday, weekend styles.
 *
 * Once the weekend start day or weekend length changes, all the weekday &
 * weekend styles are reset to the default style. It's the application's
 * responsibility to set the styles again by the sending corresponding signals.
 *
 * Supported common elm_object_item APIs.
 *
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_text_set,
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_text_get,
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_set,
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_get,
 * @li @ref elm_object_part_content_unset
 *
 * @li "day0" indicates Sunday, "day1" indicates Monday etc. continues and so,
 * "day6" indicates the Saturday part name.
 *
 * Application can change individual day display string by using the API
 * elm_object_part_text_set().
 *
 * elm_object_part_content_set() API sets the individual day object only if
 * the passed one is a Check widget.
 *
 * Check object representing a day can be set/get by the application by using
 * the elm_object_part_content_set/get APIs thus providing a way to handle
 * the different check styles for individual days.
 *
 * This widget inherits from the @ref Layout one, so that all the
 * functions acting on it also work for dayselector objects.
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref Layout:
 * @li @c "dayselector,changed" - When the user changes the state of a day.
 * @li @c "language,changed" - The program's language is changed.
 *
 * Available styles for dayselector are:
 * @li default
 *
 * This example shows the usage of the widget.
 * @li @ref dayselector_example
