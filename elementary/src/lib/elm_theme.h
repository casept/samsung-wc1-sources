/**
 * @defgroup Theme Theme
 * @ingroup elm_infra_group
 * @brief This group provides functions to handle look and feel of Elementary
 *        Widgets.
 *
 * Elementary uses Edje to theme its widgets, naturally. But for most of the
 * part this is hidden behind a simpler interface that lets the user set
 * extensions and choose the style of widgets in a much easier way.
 *
 * Instead of thinking in terms of paths to Edje files and their groups
 * each time you want to change the appearance of a widget, Elementary
 * works so you can add any theme file with extensions or replace the
 * main theme at one point in the application, and then just set the style
 * of widgets with elm_object_style_set() and related functions. Elementary
 * then looks in its list of themes for a matching group and applies it,
 * and when the theme changes midway through the application, all widgets
 * are updated accordingly.
 *
 * There are three concepts you need to know to understand how Elementary
 * themes work: default theme, extensions, and overlays.
 *
 * Default theme, obviously, is the one that provides the default
 * look for all widgets. End users can change the theme used by Elementary
 * by setting the @c ELM_THEME environment variable before running an
 * application, or globally for all programs using the @c elementary_config
 * utility. Applications can change the default theme using elm_theme_set(),
 * but this can go against the user's wishes, so it's not an advised practice.
 *
 * Ideally, applications should find everything they need in the already
 * provided theme, but there may be occasions when that's not enough and
 * custom styles are required to correctly express the idea. For such
 * cases, Elementary has extensions.
 *
 * Extensions allow the application developer to write styles of its own
 * to apply to some widgets. This requires knowledge of how each widget
 * is themed, as extensions always replace the entire group used by
 * the widget, so important signals and parts need to be there for the
 * object to behave properly (see documentation of Edje for details).
 * Once the theme for the extension is done, the application needs to add
 * it to the list of themes that Elementary will look into, using
 * elm_theme_extension_add(), and set the style of the desired widgets as
 * he would normally do using elm_object_style_set().
 *
 * Overlays, on the other hand, can replace the look of all the widgets by
 * overriding the default style. Like extensions, it's up to the application
 * developer to write the theme for the widgets it wants, the difference
 * being that when looking for the theme, Elementary checks first the
 * list of overlays, then the set theme, and lastly the list of extensions,
 * so with overlays it's possible to replace the default view and every
 * widget is affected. This is very much similar to setting the whole
 * theme for the application and probably clashing with the end user
 * options, not to mention the risk of ending up with non-matching styles
 * across the program. Unless there's a very special reason to use them,
 * overlays should be avoided for the reasons mentioned previously.
 *
 * All these theme lists are handled by ::Elm_Theme instances. Elementary
 * keeps one default theme internally and every function that receives one of
 * these can be called with @c NULL to refer to this default theme(except for
 * elm_theme_free()). It's possible to create a new instance of a
 * ::Elm_Theme to set other themes for a specific widget (and all of its
 * children), but this is as bad as, if not more than, using
 * overlays. Don't use this unless you really know what you are doing.
 *
 * But to be less negative about things, you can look at the following
 * examples:
 * @li @ref theme_example_01 "Using extensions"
 * @li @ref theme_example_02 "Using overlays"
 *
