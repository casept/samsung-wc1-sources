 *
 * @remarks This call is exported only for use by the ELM_MAIN()
 *          macro. There is no need to use this if you use this macro (which
 *          is highly advisable). An elm_main() should contain the entry

 *          elm_init(), and @b not being static (putting the @c EAPI_MAIN symbol
 *          in front of its type declaration is advisable). The
 *          ELM_MAIN() call should be placed just after it.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude bg_example_01.c
 * @skip static void
 * @until ELM_MAIN
 *
 * See the full @ref bg_example_01_c "example".

 *          any permanent resources that your application may have allocated via
