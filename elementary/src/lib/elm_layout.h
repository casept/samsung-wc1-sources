 *
 * A Layout is a direct realization of @ref elm-layout-class.
 *
 * @brief This is a container widget that takes a standard Edje design file and
 *        wraps it very thinly in a widget.
 *
 * An Edje design (theme) file has a very wide range of possibilities to
 * describe the behavior of elements added to the Layout. Check out the Edje
 * documentation and the EDC reference to get more information about what can
 * be done with Edje.
 *
 * Just like @ref List, @ref Box, and other container widgets, any
 * object added to the Layout becomes its child, meaning that it is
 * deleted if the Layout is deleted, moved if the Layout is moved, and so on.
 *
 * The Layout widget can contain as many Contents, Boxes, or Tables as
 * described in its theme file. For instance, objects can be added to
 * different Tables by specifying the respective Table part names. The same
 * is valid for Contents and Boxes.
 *
 * The objects added as the child of the Layout behave as described in the
 * part description where they were added. There are 3 possible types of
 * parts where a child can be added:
 *
 * @section secContent Content (SWALLOW part)
 *
 * Only one object can be added to the @c SWALLOW part (but you still can
 * have many @c SWALLOW parts and one object on each of them). Use the
 * elm_object_content_set/get/unset functions to set, retrieve, and unset
 * objects as content of the @c SWALLOW. After being set to this part, the
 * object size, position, visibility, clipping, and other description
 * properties are totally controlled by the description of the given part
 * (inside the Edje theme file).
 *
 * One can use @c evas_object_size_hint_* functions on the child to have some
 * kind of control over its behavior, but the resulting behavior still
 * depends heavily on the @c SWALLOW part description.
 *
 * The Edje theme also can change the part description, based on signals or
 * scripts running inside the theme. This change can also be animated. All of
 * this affects the child object set as the content accordingly. The object
 * size changes if the part size is changed, it animates move if
 * the part is moving, and so on.
 *
 * The following picture demonstrates a Layout widget with a child object
 * added to its @c SWALLOW:
 *
 * @image html layout_swallow.png
 * @image latex layout_swallow.eps width=\textwidth
 *
 * @section secBox Box (BOX part)
 *
 * An Edje @c BOX part is very similar to the Elementary @ref Box widget. It
 * allows one to add objects to the box and have them distributed along its
 * area, accordingly as per the specified @a layout property (now by @a layout we
 * mean the chosen layouting design of the Box, not the Layout widget
 * itself).
 *
 * A similar effect for having a box with its position, size, and other things
 * controlled by the Layout theme would be to create an Elementary @ref Box
 * widget and add it as Content in the @c SWALLOW part.
 *
 * The main difference of using the Layout Box is that its behavior, the box
 * properties like layouting format, padding, align, etc. is all
 * controlled by the theme. This means, for example, that a signal could be
 * sent to the Layout theme (with elm_object_signal_emit()) and the theme
 * handles the signal by changing the box padding, or alignment, or both. Using
 * the Elementary @ref Box widget is not necessarily harder or easier, it
 * just depends on the circumstances and requirements.
 *
 * The Layout Box can be used through the @c elm_layout_box_* set of
 * functions.
 *
 * The following picture demonstrates a Layout widget with many child objects
 * added to its @c BOX part:
 *
 * @image html layout_box.png
 * @image latex layout_box.eps width=\textwidth
 *
 * @section secTable Table (TABLE part)
 *
 * Just like the @ref secBox, the Layout Table is very similar to the
 * Elementary @ref Table widget. It allows one to add objects to the Table
 * specifying the row and column where the object should be added, and any
 * column or row span if necessary.
 *
 * Again, we could have this design by adding a @ref Table widget to the @c
 * SWALLOW part using elm_object_part_content_set(). The same difference happens
 * here when choosing to use the Layout Table (a @c TABLE part) instead of
 * the @ref Table plus @c SWALLOW part. It's just a matter of convenience.
 *
 * The Layout Table can be used through the @c elm_layout_table_* set of
 * functions.
 *
 * The following picture demonstrates a Layout widget with many child objects
 * added to its @c TABLE part:
 *
 * @image html layout_table.png
 * @image latex layout_table.eps width=\textwidth
 *
 * @section secPredef Predefined Layouts
 *
 * Another interesting thing about the Layout widget is that it offers some
 * predefined themes that come with the default Elementary theme. These
 * themes can be set by elm_layout_theme_set(), and can provide some
 * basic functionality depending on the theme used.
 *
 * Most of them already send some signals, some already provide a toolbar or
 * back and next buttons.
 *
 * These are available, predefined theme layouts. All of them have class = @c
 * layout, group = @c application, and style = one of the following options:
 *
 * @li @c toolbar-content - Application with a toolbar and main content area.
 * @li @c toolbar-content-back - Application with a toolbar and main content
 * area having a back button and title area.
 * @li @c toolbar-content-back-next - Application with a toolbar and main
 * content area having back and next buttons and a title area.
 * @li @c content-back - Application with a main content area having a back
 * button and title area.
 * @li @c content-back-next - Application with a main content area having
 * back and next buttons and a title area.
 * @li @c toolbar-vbox - Application with a toolbar and main content area as a
 * vertical box.
 * @li @c toolbar-table - Application with a toolbar and main content area as a
 * table.
 *
 * Supported common elm_object APIs.
