Bugs:
  pager is not smooth at large sizes
  large tooltips do not work with compositing enabled
  toolbar sizing is broken in some cases (WEIGHT(0,0) in horizontal box with entry WEIGHT(EXPAND,EXPAND))

Things That Just Need To Be Rewritten (tm):
  toolbar icon api is broken, should take an actual elm_icon. requires new elm_toolbar_item_update api as well
  panel edc

"Features"
  elm_object_icon_s/get() should be implemented for most widgets to reduce api

callbacks add/del
  pager, panes
