2.31.2

	* Added gnutls-pkcs11 backend, which uses gnutls 2.12.8 and
	  p11-kit (a new optional dependency) to provide access to
	  PKCS#11 tokens. At the moment, this is only enabled if you
	  set GIO_USE_TLS=gnutls-pkcs11 in the environment. (Stef,
	  #656361)

	* GTlsCertificateGnutls can now read unencrypted PKCS#8 keys
	  (which show "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" in PEM form) in addition to

	  g_tls_connection_close_async() (Dan, #659786) or a NULL
	  GError to g_tls_file_database_new().

	* Fixed handling of self-signed CA certificates in
	  GTlsDatabaseGnutls (Dan, #660508)

	* Added another G_TLS_ERROR_NOT_TLS (aka "dumb server, try
	  falling back from TLS to SSLv3") case, when the handshake
	  completes but then packets after that don't decrypt
	  correctly. (Dan, #662104)

	* Made sure that GTlsConnection:peer-certificate and
          :peer-certificate-errors get set even when the peer
          certificate is rejected. (Dan)

  * proxy/gnome
	* Fixed ignore_hosts handling (Dan, #655581)

	* Fixed configure check so that "--without-gnome-proxy" works.
	  (Alexandre Rostovtsev, #662203)

2.29.92
=======
  * New/updated translations:

  * gnutls: Fixed a problem when linking against GNUTLS 3.0, where
    connections would sometimes return the error "The TLS connection
    was non-properly terminated". (Dan Winship, #659233)

  * gnutls: Plugged a few memory leaks (Dan Winship)

2.29.18
=======
  * gnutls: fixed two rehandshaking bugs; one in which a client
    would erroneously report an error after successfully rehandshaking
    (Igor Makarov, #653645), and one where initiating an asynchronous
    rehandshake on the server side would send illegal packets and
    cause the client to disconnect (Dan Winship).

  * gnutls: made GTlsDatabaseGnutls and GTlsFileDatabaseGnutls
    properly cancellable (Stef Walter)

  * gnutls: fixed the client-side session cache to not share session
    IDs between different virtual hosts on the same IP address, which
    caused problems with some servers. (Dan Winship, #581342)

  * tls: Fixed up the tls test program so it can be run from "make
    check" (Stef Walter)

  * New translations:
	Persian

2.29.15
=======
  * gnutls: implement GTlsDatabase (Stef Walter, #636572)

  * gnutls: override minimum key length, to allow connecting to HTTP
    servers with very small keys (eg, on some embedded devices). (Dan
    Winship, #652284).

  * gnutls: use %COMPAT mode, which makes GNUTLS behave more like
    OpenSSL/NSS/Windows in a few ways, making it work with certain
    broken HTTP servers. (Dan Winship, part of #581342)

  * gnutls: fixed a crash when passed a NULL GError (Dan Winship)

2.29.9
======

  * New/updated translations:
	Basque, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Traditional), Danish,

2.28.4
======
  * Added a new proxy backend, GProxyResolverGnome, that uses
    GSettings and the network proxy schemas from
    gsettings-desktop-schemas to provide proxy information (and using
    a new D-Bus service provided by the libproxy backend to provide
    PAC/WPAD support).

    If you are building glib-networking in a GNOME 3.0 environment,
    you should make sure that gsettings-desktop-schemas.pc is
    available when building, so that this backend gets built.

  * New translations:
	Assamese, Latvian, Oriya, Serbian
