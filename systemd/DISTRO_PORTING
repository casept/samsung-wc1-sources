Porting systemd To New Distributions

HOWTO:
        You need to make the follow changes to adapt systemd to your
        distribution:

        1) Find the right configure parameters for:

            --with-rootprefix=
            --with-sysvinit-path=
            --with-sysvrcnd-path=
            --with-rc-local-script-path-start=
            --with-rc-local-script-path-stop=
            --with-kbd-loadkeys=
            --with-kbd-setfont=
            --with-tty-gid=

        2) Try it out. Play around with 'systemd --test --system' for
        a test run of systemd without booting. This will read the unit
        files and print the initial transaction it would execute
        during boot-up. This will also inform you about ordering loops
        and suchlike.

CONTRIBUTING UPSTREAM:

        We do generally no longer accept distribution-specific
        patches to systemd upstream. If you have to make changes to
        systemd's source code to make it work on your distribution:
        unless your code is generic enough to be generally useful, we
        are unlikely to merge it. Please always consider adopting the
        upstream defaults. If that is not possible, please maintain
        the relevant patches downstream.

        Thank you for understanding.
