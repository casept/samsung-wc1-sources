                <title>Description</title>

                <para>A unit configuration file whose name ends in
                <literal>.timer</literal> encodes information about
                a timer controlled and supervised by systemd, for
                timer-based activation.</para>

                <para>This man page lists the configuration options
                specific to this unit type. See
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                for the common options of all unit configuration
                files. The common configuration items are configured
                in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
                timer specific configuration options are configured in
                the [Timer] section.</para>

                <para>For each timer file, a matching unit file must
                exist, describing the unit to activate when the timer
                elapses. By default, a service by the same name as the
                timer (except for the suffix) is activated. Example: a
                timer file <filename>foo.timer</filename> activates a
                matching service <filename>foo.service</filename>. The
                unit to activate may be controlled by
                <varname>Unit=</varname> (see below).</para>

                <para>Unless <varname>DefaultDependencies=</varname>
                is set to <option>false</option>, all timer units will
                implicitly have dependencies of type
                <varname>Conflicts=</varname> and
                <varname>Before=</varname> on
                <filename>shutdown.target</filename> to ensure that
                they are stopped cleanly prior to system shutdown.
                Timer units with at least one
                <varname>OnCalendar=</varname> directive will have an
                additional <varname>After=</varname> dependency on
                <filename>timer-sync.target</filename> to avoid
                being started before the system clock has been
                correctly set. Only timer units involved with early
                boot or late system shutdown should disable the
                <varname>DefaultDependencies=</varname> option.</para>

                <para>Timer files must include a [Timer] section,
                which carries information about the timer it
                defines. The options specific to the [Timer] section
                of timer units are the following:</para>

                                combined of the same and of different
                                types. For example, by combining
                                <varname>OnBootSec=</varname> and
                                <varname>OnUnitActiveSec=</varname>, it is
                                possible to define a timer that
                                elapses in regular intervals and
                                activates a specific service each
                                time.</para>

                                <para>The arguments to the directives
                                are time spans configured in
                                seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means
                                50s after boot-up. The argument may
                                also include time units. Example:
                                "OnBootSec=5h 30min" means 5 hours and
                                30 minutes after boot-up. For details
                                about the syntax of time spans, see

                                unit is activated, it will immediately
                                elapse and the configured unit is
                                started. This is not the case for

                                the time when the timer was inactive.
                                This is useful to catch up on missed
                                runs of the service when the machine
                                was off. Note that this setting only
                                has an effect on timers configured
                                with <varname>OnCalendar=</varname>.
