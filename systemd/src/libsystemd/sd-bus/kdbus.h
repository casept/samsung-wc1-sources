/**
 * enum kdbus_ioctl_type - Ioctl API
 * @KDBUS_CMD_BUS_MAKE:		After opening the "control" device node, this
 *				command creates a new bus with the specified
 *				name. The bus is immediately shut down and
 *				cleaned up when the opened "control" device node
 *				is closed.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_DOMAIN_MAKE:	Similar to KDBUS_CMD_BUS_MAKE, but it creates a
 *				new kdbus domain.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_EP_MAKE:		Creates a new named special endpoint to talk to
 *				the bus. Such endpoints usually carry a more
 *				restrictive policy and grant restricted access
 *				to specific applications.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_HELLO:		By opening the bus device node a connection is
 *				created. After a HELLO the opened connection
 *				becomes an active peer on the bus.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_BYEBYE:		Disconnect a connection. If the connection's
 *				message list is empty, the calls succeeds, and
 *				the handle is rendered unusable. Otherwise,
 *				-EAGAIN is returned without any further side-
 *				effects.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_MSG_SEND:		Send a message and pass data from userspace to
 *				the kernel.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_MSG_RECV:		Receive a message from the kernel which is
 *				placed in the receiver's pool.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_MSG_CANCEL:	Cancel a pending request of a message that
 *				blocks while waiting for a reply. The parameter
 *				denotes the cookie of the message in flight.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_FREE:		Release the allocated memory in the receiver's
 *				pool.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_NAME_ACQUIRE:	Request a well-known bus name to associate with
 *				the connection. Well-known names are used to
 *				address a peer on the bus.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_NAME_RELEASE:	Release a well-known name the connection
 *				currently owns.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_NAME_LIST:	Retrieve the list of all currently registered
 *				well-known and unique names.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_CONN_INFO:	Retrieve credentials and properties of the
 *				initial creator of the connection. The data was
 *				stored at registration time and does not
 *				necessarily represent the connected process or
 *				the actual state of the process.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_CONN_UPDATE:	Update the properties of a connection. Used to
 *				update the metadata subscription mask and
 *				policy.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_EP_UPDATE:	Update the properties of a custom enpoint. Used
 *				to update the policy.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_MATCH_ADD:	Install a match which broadcast messages should
 *				be delivered to the connection.
 * @KDBUS_CMD_MATCH_REMOVE:	Remove a current match for broadcast messages.
