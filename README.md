# About

This is a copy of GPL-licensed software used by Samsung for the Gear S2 (Classic) (SM-R720/SM-R732, codename "WC1").

I decided to re-publish this here, as Samsung's open source portal is a massive pain with slow downloads and source for old products being frequently removed.

The most interesting part are probably the kernel sources, not sure whether Samsung has modified any of the other software.

Kernel sources for various Exynos3250 watches have been aggregated at https://github.com/casept/linux-exynos3250-common, please use that repository. This is for archival only.
